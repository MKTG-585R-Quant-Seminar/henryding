# Your Repository

## Repository Organization

Each of your repositories will have a similar organization. There are
certain limitations on the size and type of files that can be pushed to
GitHub. There are also certain things that shouldnâ€™t be accessible by
the public (e.g., data we have a license to access). For these reasons,
we have folders and files that are pushed to GitHub and those that are
not.

### Pushed to GitHub

- `.gitignore` This hidden file specifies what Git should ignore when
  pushing to GitHub. To add a file, include it in `.gitignore` by
  specifying the folder and file name, like so: `Folder/File.extension`.
- `/Articles` You can save .pdfs of articles you find interesting here. Consider organizing them based on what we cover in class vs. what you are using for your project.
- `/Notes` If you take notes, save them here for future reference.
- `/Other` Store anything that doesn't fall into one of the other folders here.
- `/Project Deliverables` Contains folders for submitting each of your project deliverables.
- `README` This page, with any other organization details to make it
  easy to navigate your repository.

### Not Pushed to GitHub

- `Data/` due to storage limitations, we typically don't push data to Github.
